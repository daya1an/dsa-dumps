In Binary tree, each node can have at most two children.
In Binary Search Tree, left child is less than the parent node and right child is greater than the parent node.

Traversals:
1. Inorder: (left, root, right)
- First Left Sub tree, then Root, then Right Sub tree.
- The Root will be in the middle of the traversal.

2. Preorder: (root, left, right)
- First Root, then Left Sub tree, then Right Sub tree.
- The Root will be at the start of the traversal.

3. Postorder: (left, right, root)
- First Left Sub tree, then Right Sub tree, then Root.
- The Root will be at the end of the traversal.
